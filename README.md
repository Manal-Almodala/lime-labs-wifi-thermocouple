# lime labs wifi thermocouple
A simple, Arduino (ESP8266 and ESP32) based WiFi thermocouple. Provides data readout via RESTful API (and soon via direct TCP sockets as well). Used by [lime labs remote reflow controller](https://github.com/lime-labs/lime-labs-remote-reflow-controller), the remote toaster/hot-plate/reflow oven controller that works over the network.
